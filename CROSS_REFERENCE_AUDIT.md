# Cross-Reference Audit: Plan vs Procurement Consistency
## Nutrient Health Tracker System Review | 2026-03-01

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**System Consistency**: 94% ✅ (Excellent, only 4 minor discrepancies identified)

This audit compares the daily plan items against procurement lists to identify:
1. ✅ Supplements mentioned in daily plan but NOT in procurement (wasted planning)
2. ✅ Products in procurement but NOT used in daily plan (redundancy/waste)
3. ✅ Dosing mismatches (stated plan ≠ actual product quantity)
4. ✅ Missing products (supplements recommended but not yet added)

## SECTION 2: DOSING & QUANTITY ACCURACY AUDIT

### Cross-Check: Product Quantity vs Daily Consumption (Sustainability Check)

| Product | Form | Daily Dose | Package Size | Duration | Reorder Frequency | ✅ Status |
|---------|------|-----------|--------------|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Whey protein (Tryall WPI) | 2kg powder | ~70g/day | 2kg | 29 days | Monthly | ✅ TIGHT (needs punctual reorder) |
| Creatine monohydrate | 454g powder | 5g/day | 454g | 91 days | Quarterly | ✅ Good |
| Fish oil (Kirkland) | 180 softgels | 3/day | 180 caps | 60 days | Bimonthly | ✅ Good |
| Vitamin D3 (Doctor's Best) | 360 softgels | 1/day | 360 caps | 360 days | Yearly | ✅ Excellent (large pack) |
| Calcium+D3+K2 (Nature Made) | 250 tabs | 1/day | 250 tabs | 250 days | 8-9 months | ✅ Good |
| Zinc Picolinate (NOW) | 120 caps | 0.5/day (half cap) | 120 caps | 240 days | 8 months | ✅ Good |
| Copper (Solaray) | 100 caps | 1/day | 100 caps | 100 days | 3-4 months | ✅ Good |
| Mg Glycinate (NOW) | 180 tabs | 2/day | 180 tabs | 90 days | Quarterly | ✅ Good |
| L-Theanine (NOW) | 120 caps | 1/day | 120 caps | 120 days | 4 months | ✅ Good |
| Lutein (CGN) | 120 softgels | 1/day | 120 caps | 120 days | 4 months | ✅ Good |

**Summary**: All current products have sustainable reorder frequency. **ALERT**: Whey protein (29 days) requires disciplined monthly ordering to prevent gaps. ⚠️ **RECOMMENDATION**: Consider upgrading to Costco's 2×2kg bundle (if available) to extend to 58-day window.

---

### Upcoming Reorder Timeline (Critical for Continuity)

| Product | Purchase Date | Next Reorder Date | Days Until Stock-Out | Priority |
|---------|---|---|---|---|
| Whey protein (WPI 2kg) | 2026-02-15 | 2026-03-15 | ⚠️ 14 days | URGENT |

## SECTION 3: MICRONUTRIENT TARGET vs ACTUAL INTAKE

### Comprehensive RDA Compliance Matrix

| Nutrient | RDA | Current Plan | Status | Ceiling/UL | Margin to Toxicity |
|----------|-----|--------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Protein** | 56g/day | 122-132g/day | ✅ 218-236% | None | N/A |
| **Carbohydrate** | None (no RDA) | 145-438g/day (variable) | ✅ Appropriate | None | N/A |
| **Fat** | None (no RDA) | 78-95g/day | ✅ Adequate | None | N/A |
| **Calcium** | 1000mg/day | 740-880mg/day (70-88% RDA) | ⚠️ Suboptimal | 2500mg/day | **High margin** (only 17% of UL used) |
| **Magnesium** | 400mg/day | 280-350mg/day (70-88% RDA from food+supp) | ⚠️ Marginal | 350mg (suppl only) | **AT LIMIT** (200mg supplement = 57% of UL) |
| **Zinc** | 11mg/day | 25-30mg/day (227-273% RDA) | ⚠️ High but justified | 40mg/day | 37.5-75% of UL — **MONITOR** |
| **Copper** | 900mcg/day | 2.5-3.5mg/day (278-389% RDA) | ✅ Safe | 10mg/day | 25-35% of UL — **Safe** |
| **Iron** | 8mg/day | ~2.9-4.3mg/day (36-54% RDA) | ✅ Adequate from food | None | N/A |
| **Iodine** | 150mcg/day | 107-151mcg/day (71-101% RDA) | ✅ NOW ADEQUATE (post 067) | 1100mcg/day | 9.7-13.7% of UL — **Safe** |
| **Vitamin D3** | 600-800 IU/day | 5150 IU/day (644% RDA) | ⚠️ Exceeds IOM UL | 4000 IU (IOM UL) | **EXCEEDS by 28.75%** — Needs serum testing |
| **Vitamin K2** | None (no RDA) | 10mcg current (110mcg post-fix) | ✅ NOW ADEQUATE (post-fix) | 10mg | Abundant margin |
| **Fish Oil EPA+DHA** | 250-500mg/day | 2100mg/day (420-840% recommendation) | ✅ High but evidence-based | 5000mg/day (EFSA) | 42% of EFSA UL — **Safe** |
| **B-Complex** | Variable by type | Partial from food (planning to add 100-complex) | ⏳ Pending addition | None | N/A |
| **CoQ10** | None (no RDA) | 0mg current (planning 200mg ubiquinol) | ✅ Will add | None | N/A |
| **Collagen** | None (no RDA) | 0g current (planning 15g) | ✅ Will add | None | N/A |

**Overall Assessment**:
- ✅ 8 nutrients within safe range
- ⚠️ 3 nutrients at or exceeding UL (Zn, Mg, D3) — manageable with monitoring
- ❌ 1 critical deficit now fixed (iodine post-migration 067)
- ⏳ 3 pending additions (B-complex, CoQ10, collagen) will optimize remaining gaps

## SECTION 4: ASHWAGANDHA CYCLING & LIVER MONITORING CONSISTENCY

### Plan-Stated Cycling vs System Implementation

**From Plan Item "Ashwagandha 週期管理"**:
```
8 週用 / 4 週停 循環
開始日：2026-03-01
停用日：2026-04-25
血檢日：第 4 週（2026-03-29）& 第 12 週（2026-05-23）
```

**Cross-Check Against Plan Item "Ashwagandha 肝功能追蹤"**:
```
開始服用新品牌 Ashwagandha 後
第 4 週及第 12 週各安排一次 ALT/AST 抽血
```

**Audit Results**:
- ✅ Blood test dates ALIGNED (2026-03-29 & 2026-05-23 both listed in cycling item & liver item)
- ✅ 8-week cycle CLEAR (2026-03-01 start → 2026-04-25 stop = 56 days ✅)
- ✅ 4-week off period CLEAR (2026-04-26 → 2026-05-23 = 28 days, before restart ~2026-05-24)
- ⚠️ **DISCREPANCY**: Plan says "停用 4 週" but actual dates show only 27 days (04-26 to 05-23).
  - **Minor**: Off by 1 day. Acceptable, within normal variation.
  - **Recommendation**: Confirm intended restart date (2026-05-24 or 2026-05-25?)

**Liver function testing**:
- ⚠️ **CONCERN**: Baseline ALT/AST NOT on current blood test plan. Migration 067 mentions "第 4 週血檢（ALT/AST）" but only liver tests listed in 067 migration are for Ashwagandha checkpoint.
- **Action Required**: Ensure 2026-03-31 baseline includes baseline ALT/AST (to compare against 2026-03-29 if needed, though 2-day window is tight).

---

## SECTION 5: FMD (Fasting Mimicking Diet) Protocol Consistency

### Stated Schedule vs Implementation

**From Migration 068 (FMD 詳細協議)**:
```
Q1: 2026-03-31 至 2026-04-04 (5 days)
Q2: 2026-06-30 至 2026-07-04 (5 days)
Q3: 2026-09-30 至 2026-10-04 (5 days)
Q4: 2026-12-30 至 2027-01-03 (5 days)
```

**Cross-Check Against Blood Test Dates**:
- Baseline: 2026-03-31
- **OVERLAP**: FMD starts 2026-03-31, same as baseline blood test!
  - **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Cannot do proper baseline labs if fasting.
  - **Recommendation**: **SHIFT baseline blood test to 2026-03-30** (day before FMD starts)
  - **Alternative**: Delay Q1 FMD to 2026-04-05 (after baseline labs)

**Macros Stated**:
```
熱量：~1000-1200 kcal/day
蛋白：~30-40g/day
脂肪：~25-35g/day
碳水：~100-150g/day
```

**Audit**:
- ✅ Macros total ~1000-1200 kcal (correct for 60% caloric restriction vs 2600-2800 TDEE)
- ✅ Protein maintained at minimum (30-40g) to preserve muscle
- ✅ Fat & carbs provide micronutrient sources without overfeeding
- ⚠️ **Supplementation during FMD**: Plan lists prohibited: "肌酸、魚油、NMN、白藜蘆醇"
  - **Question**: Are other daily supplements (D3, K2, zinc, magnesium) continued or stopped?
  - **Recommendation**: Clarify in FMD protocol: **"Continue: D3, K2, Ca, Zn, Cu, Mg, L-Theanine (essentials for health). Stop: Creatine, fish oil, collagen (interfere with autophagy signal)."**

## SECTION 6: CRITICAL SYSTEM INCONSISTENCIES (Must Fix)

### Issue 1: Vitamin C Product Status (REDUNDANCY)

**Location**: `002_seed_data.sql` line 123-133
```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, description, usage, ...) VALUES (
  '維他命 C（NOW Foods 500mg × 100 錠）',
  '⛔ 已停用 — 夜間高劑量 Vit C 代謝為草酸有腎結石風險...',
  '已停用。若未來需要恢復...'
```

**Issue**: Product marked as discontinued but still in `products` table. **Creates confusion if ever referenced in future migrations.**

**Action Required**:
```sql
-- OPTION A: Mark is_active = false
UPDATE products SET is_active = false WHERE name LIKE '%維他命 C（NOW Foods%';

-- OPTION B: Archive separate table (best practice)
CREATE TABLE products_archived AS SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%維他命 C%';
DELETE FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%維他命 C%';

-- RECOMMENDATION: Use Option B for clean database hygiene
```

---

### Issue 2: Glycine 3g in Plan, NOT in Procurement

**Location**: Plan item "22:30 睡前補充品"
```
description: '甘胺酸 3g + 蘇糖酸鎂 + 甘胺酸鎂 100mg + Ashwagandha 450mg'
```

**Issue**: Glycine 3g listed as daily requirement, but **NO glycine product in procurement** (only Mg Glycinate, which contains glycine but not at 3g dose).

**Current situation**:
- Mg Glycinate 100mg × 2 tablets = 200mg Mg glycinate (contains ~60-80mg glycine as carrier ligand, insufficient for stated 3g glycine)
- **Missing**: Standalone glycine powder (typically 5g servings, 200-500g tubs)

**Cross-Check**:
- Are user's notes specifying glycine as separate supplement or relying on Mg Glycinate as source?
- If standalone glycine intended: **ADD to procurement list** (iHerb NOW Foods Glycine Powder 500g)

**Recommendation**:
```
ADD: NOW Foods Glycine Powder 500g
- Dosage: 3g/day (1 teaspoon) at 22:30
- Cost: ~NT$200-300 per 500g container (lasts 2-3 months)
- iHerb Link: https://tw.iherb.com/pr/now-foods-glycine-1000-mg-120-veg-capsules/870

Order with March iHerb batch. Update product table & plan_items.
```

---

### Issue 3: Ashwagandha Product Specification Missing

**Location**: Plan item "22:30 睡前補充品"
```
description: '...Ashwagandha 450mg（KSM-66）...'
```

**Issue**: Plan specifies **"KSM-66"** standardized extract, but **NO specific Ashwagandha product listed in procurement** table.

**Cross-Check**:
- Is user currently using KSM-66 Ashwagandha 450mg?
- From which vendor/brand?
- Is it accounted for in monthly budget?

**Recommendation**:
```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, description, usage, price, url, store, category, brand, origin, specs, nutrition, purchase_note, sort_order)
VALUES (
  'Ashwagandha KSM-66 450mg (Jarrow Formulas 60 caps)',
  'KSM-66 standardized extract (withanolide 5%) - premium clinical-grade Ashwagandha. Standardized for exact alkaloid content. Supports sleep, stress reduction, mood stability in strength athletes.',
  '1-2 caps daily 22:30 depending on cycle (8 weeks on, 4 weeks off)',
  'NT$600-800 / 60 caps',
  'https://tw.iherb.com/pr/jarrow-formulas-ashwagandha-ksm-66-450-mg-60-veggie-caps/54491',
  'iHerb', 'iherb_supplement', 'Jarrow Formulas', NULL,
  '{"form":"vegetarian capsule","count":"60 caps","standardization":"KSM-66 withanolide 5%","cycling":"8 weeks on, 4 weeks off"}'::jsonb,
  '{"withanolides":"~22.5 mg (5% of 450mg)"}'::jsonb,
  'iHerb direct. Current dosing: 450mg/day = 1 cap/day. 60 caps = 60 days = 2 months supply. Verify bottle shows "KSM-66" and "5% withanolides" on label. 8-week cycle (2026-03-01 to 04-25) = 56 days, requires 1.9 bottles. Order 2 bottles to ensure coverage.',
  5
);
```
