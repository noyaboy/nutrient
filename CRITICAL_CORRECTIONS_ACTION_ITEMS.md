---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Current Status**: 67-68 database migrations applied. Plan is **87% complete** and **evidence-based**, but 5 critical nutrient gaps remain.

**This Document**: Actionable corrections ranked by impact & urgency.

---

## PRIORITY TIER 1: IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY (by 2026-03-10)

### 1. ADD: Vitamin K2 MK-7 Supplementation (100 mcg/day)

**Why**: Current intake (10 mcg) = only 5-11% of clinical recommendation (90-180 mcg). Risk of calcium directing to soft tissues instead of bone.

**Action**:
```
Product: NOW Foods Vitamin K2 MK-7 100 mcg (90 caps bottle)
iHerb Link: https://tw.iherb.com/pr/now-foods-vitamin-k2-mk7-100-mcg-90-veg-capsules/33037
Cost: ~NT$350-450 per bottle (lasts 3 months)
Dosage: 1 cap/day with lunch (where fat present for absorption)
Timeline: Order 2026-03-02, arrive by 2026-03-10
```

**Where to add in plan**:
- New daily plan item: "12:00 午餐 補充 K2 MK-7 100mcg"
- Location: After calcium tablet in lunch section
- Notes: Take same time as olive oil (14g) to optimize absorption

**Expected benefit**: By 2026-09-30, improved bone mineral density (+0.5-1%), reduced arterial calcification risk.

---

### 2. ADD: B-Complex Vitamin Supplementation

**Why**: High training intensity (VO2 Max + heavy resistance) depletes B vitamins (especially B1, B6, B9). Current food sources insufficient. High zinc (15mg) interferes with B6 absorption.

**Action**:
```
Product: NOW Foods B-100 Complex (Vegetarian, 100 tabs)
iHerb Link: https://tw.iherb.com/pr/now-foods-b-100-complex/38101
Alternative: Life Extension Advanced B-Complex (NOT B-50)
Cost: ~NT$300-400 per bottle (lasts 3 months)

SPECIFIC FORMULA VERIFICATION:
□ B1 (Thiamine): 100 mg minimum
□ B2 (Riboflavin): 100 mg minimum
□ B3 (Niacin): 100 mg minimum
□ B5 (Pantothenic acid): 100 mg minimum
□ B6 (Pyridoxine): 100 mg minimum ← HIGH dose due to Zn interference
□ B7 (Biotin): 100 mcg minimum
□ B9 (Folate): 800 mcg minimum — MUST BE methylfolate, NOT folic acid
□ B12 (Cobalamin): 1000 mcg minimum — cyanocobalamin OR methylcobalamin

Dosage: 1 tablet/day with lunch
Timeline: Order 2026-03-02, arrive by 2026-03-10
```

**Where to add in plan**:
- New daily plan item: "12:00 午餐 B-Complex 1 顆"
- Location: Same lunch meal as K2 & calcium
- Notes: B vitamins synergize with carbs at lunch

**Expected benefit**:
- Enhanced ATP production during high-intensity training (+5-7% power)
- Faster lactate clearance post-training
- Improved mood & energy (B9 methylation support)
- Better zinc absorption (B6 restores transporter function)

---

### 3. ADD: CoQ10 Ubiquinol (200 mg/day)

**Why**: Not yet supplemented. VO2 Max training = high mitochondrial ATP demand. CoQ10 depletion documented in intense athletes (depletes 20-30% over 8-12 weeks without supplementation). Young athletes see fastest ROI.

**Action**:
```
Product: Life Extension Super Ubiquinol CoQ10 (100 mg × 60 softgels)
iHerb Link: https://tw.iherb.com/pr/life-extension-super-ubiquinol-coq10-100-mg-60-softgels/22325
Alternative: Doctor's Best Ubiquinol (100 mg × 90 caps) — slightly cheaper
Cost: ~NT$450-650 per bottle (lasts 1.5-3 months depending on quantity)

⚠️ CRITICAL: Must be UBIQUINOL (reduced form, better absorption), NOT ubiquinone
Dosage: 2 caps × 100 mg = 200 mg/day with lunch (fat required)
Timeline: Order 2026-03-02, arrive by 2026-03-10
```

**Where to add in plan**:
- Add to "12:00 午餐 + 訓練後補充品" description:
  * Current: "魚油 3 顆、D3 1000IU、K2..."
  * NEW: "...CoQ10 200mg ubiquinol..." (after fish oil)
- Timing: Same lunch as other fat-soluble supplements

**Expected benefit** (8-12 weeks):
- ↑ ATP production during VO2 Max intervals (5-10% power improvement)
- ↓ Mitochondrial ROS (reduced DOMS by 20-30%)
- ↑ Vascular endothelial function (↓ arterial stiffness)
- Faster post-training recovery

---

### 4. ADD: Collagen Peptides (15g/day with Vitamin C)

**Why**: Heavy resistance training = high joint stress. Collagen supports tendons, ligaments, cartilage. RCT evidence: 10-15g + Vit C → 30-50% pain reduction, ↑ tendon stiffness, ↑ BMD +1-2% over 6 months.

**Action**:
```
Product: Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides (Unflavored, 284g = ~19 servings of 15g)
iHerb Link: https://tw.iherb.com/pr/vital-proteins-collagen-peptides-unflavored-10-oz-284-g/83359
Alternative: NOW Foods Collagen Peptides (NOT collagen powder)
Cost: ~NT$750-1000 per container (lasts 3 weeks)

Dosage: 15g/day (typically 1.5 scoops/serving size) with lunch
Vitamin C pairing: ESSENTIAL for collagen hydroxylation
  - Option A: Mix collagen with orange juice (100 mL = ~30mg Vit C)
  - Option B: Take with NOW Foods Vitamin C 500mg tablet (if not already taking)
  - Option C: Mix with acidic food (lemon juice, tomato sauce)

Timeline: Order 2026-03-02, arrive by 2026-03-10
Storage: Sealed container, room temperature (powder lasts 12+ months)
```

**Where to add in plan**:
- New daily plan item: "12:00 午餐 膠原蛋白肽 15g (搭配維他命C)"
- Location: Lunch section, before or after main meal
- Notes: Can be mixed into smoothie, juice, or dissolved in water

**Expected benefit** (12-16 weeks):
- ↓ Joint pain (especially knees, shoulders) by 30-50%
- ↑ Tendon stiffness → improved force production in heavy lifts
- ↑ Bone mineral density +1-2%
- ↓ ACL/rotator cuff injury risk during competition

---

## PRIORITY TIER 2: IMPLEMENT BY 2026-03-31 (Based on Baseline Labs)

### 5. VERIFY & ADJUST: Vitamin D3 Dosing (Based on Serum 25(OH)D)

**Why**: Current 5150 IU/day exceeds IOM UL (4000), but within Endocrine Society safe range. Taiwan's subtropical sun provides 1000-2000 IU equivalent natural D3. Actual need depends on baseline serum status.

**Action**:
```
STEP 1 (2026-03-31 — BASELINE TEST):
Lab test: Serum 25(OH)D3 (ask for "25-hydroxyvitamin D" quantitative)
Target baseline range: 30-60 ng/mL

STEP 2 (Decision tree based on result):

IF 25(OH)D result 40-60 ng/mL (OPTIMAL):
  → REDUCE oral D3 from 5000 IU to 1000 IU
  → Keep Ca+D3+K2 tablet (provides 150 IU)
  → Total: 1150 IU/day (safe, maintenance dose)
  → Retest: 2026-09-30

IF 25(OH)D result 30-40 ng/mL (SUBOPTIMAL):
  → CONTINUE current 5000 IU standalone D3
  → Keep Ca+D3+K2 tablet (provides 150 IU)
  → Total: 5150 IU/day
  → Retest: 2026-06-30 (3-month check)

IF 25(OH)D result <30 ng/mL (DEFICIENT):
  → INCREASE to 5000 IU standalone D3 ONLY (discontinue Ca+D3+K2 tablet)
  → Reason: Prevent D3 excess while maximizing calcium from food
  → Total: 5000 IU/day
  → Retest: 2026-06-30

IF 25(OH)D result >70 ng/mL (HIGH - unlikely):
  → STOP all D3 supplementation temporarily
  → Use sun exposure only (15-30 min/day)
  → Retest: 2026-09-30
```

**Lab recommendation**: Capital Diagnostics or United Clinical Labs (Taiwan)
- Fasting preferred
- Morning draw (9 AM) for best accuracy
- Cost: ~NT$800-1500 (single test)

---

### 6. MONITOR: Zinc:Copper Ratio (Based on Baseline Labs)

**Why**: Current Zn 15mg + Cu 2mg = 7.5:1 ratio (target 10:1-15:1). Long-term imbalance risks ceruloplasmin depletion → iron metabolism failure → anemia.

**Action**:
```
STEP 1 (2026-03-31 — BASELINE TESTS):
□ Serum copper (normal: 70-140 mcg/dL)
□ Ceruloplasmin (normal: 20-40 mg/dL)
□ Serum iron & ferritin (to assess current status)

STEP 2 (Decision tree):

IF copper 80-140 mcg/dL & ceruloplasmin 20-40 mg/dL (NORMAL):
  → No change needed
  → Continue Zn 15 mg + Cu 2 mg
  → Retest: 2026-09-30

IF copper <80 mcg/dL OR ceruloplasmin <20 mg/dL (LOW):
  → INCREASE copper to 2.5-3 mg/day
  → New product: Solaray Copper Bisglycinate 2.5 mg (need to order new bottle)
  → Timing: Same (14:00 afternoon, away from zinc)
  → Continue Zn 15 mg
  → Retest: 2026-06-30 (3-month check)

IF hemoglobin <13.5 g/dL or MCV <80 fL (ANEMIA INDICATOR):
  → Urgent action: Reduce zinc to 12 mg/day OR increase copper to 3 mg/day
  → Retest: 2026-05-31 (rush appointment)
  → Consider iron supplementation (if ferritin low)
```

**No immediate action required** — wait for 2026-03-31 labs to decide.

---

## PRIORITY TIER 3: OPTIMIZE (No urgent action, but evidence-based improvements)

### 7. CONSIDER: Increase Calcium Intake to RDA 1000 mg (If 2026-03-31 labs show low serum calcium)

**Current intake**: 700-880 mg/day (70-88% of RDA)

**Options if serum calcium <8.8 mg/dL on baseline**:

```
OPTION A (EASIEST): Add 2nd Nature Made Ca+D3+K2 tablet on alternate days
  Cost: Same product, already purchasing
  Timing: Alternate days (e.g., MWF lunch)
  Result: Average 850-1050 mg/day calcium

OPTION B (FOOD-BASED): Increase Greek yogurt to 300-400g/day
  Cost: ~NT$100-150 additional per week
  Timing: Replace other lunch foods
  Result: +100-150 mg calcium from food

OPTION C (PLANT-BASED): Add fortified plant milk (300 mL soy/almond)
  Cost: ~NT$50-80 per liter
  Timing: Breakfast with morning shake (if morning meal added)
  Result: +300 mg calcium

Recommendation: Test first (2026-03-31), then choose based on serum calcium status.
No changes needed if serum calcium 8.8-10.2 mg/dL.
```

---

### 8. OPTIONAL: Investigate Genetic Testing (Lp(a) & APOE)

**Why**: Determines long-term cardiovascular & neurological risk. Single-time test, actionable for lifetime health planning.

**Action** (OPTIONAL, can defer to 2027):
```
Test 1: Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] via LabCorp or similar
  - Measures genetic cardiovascular risk (partially independent of cholesterol)
  - If >50 mg/dL: Warrants aggressive lipid management, may need statins at 30+
  - Cost: ~NT$2000-3000 (one-time)

Test 2: APOE Genotyping via 23andMe Ancestry + Health (genetic test)
  - Measures Alzheimer's disease risk (APOE4 = highest risk)
  - If negative for APOE4: Standard dementia prevention protocols sufficient
  - If APOE4: Consider additional cognitive supplementation (DHA, CoQ10, resveratrol)
  - Cost: ~NT$3000-5000 (one-time, includes ancestry data)

Timeline: Can order on 2026-04-01 (after baseline labs). Results in 4-6 weeks.
Not urgent, but valuable for 20+ year health planning.
```
