### 5. SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATION: Physiological Rationale (27 KB)
📄 **File**: `/PHYSIOLOGICAL_RATIONALE.md`

**The "why this works" document** — Evidence-based mechanisms with:
- **Part 1**: Macronutrient foundations (protein 1.7-1.8 g/kg, carb cycling, fat strategy)
- **Part 2**: Micronutrient critical pathways (D3, K2, iodine, zinc mechanisms)
- **Part 3**: Supplemental nutrient rationale (collagen, CoQ10, B-complex justification)
- **Part 4**: System-wide integration principles (absorption optimization, competitive inhibition map)
- **Part 5**: Athletic performance predictions (6-month outcomes with evidence)

**Time**: 20-25 minutes
**Audience**: Curious users, health professionals, coaches wanting scientific foundation
**Key Concepts**:
- K2 is calcium's "traffic director" (directs to bone, not soft tissues)
- Zinc depletion of CoQ10 occurs over 8-12 weeks without supplementation in VO2 Max athletes
- Phytate timing (low-phytate dinner carbs) critical for zinc absorption
- Collagen requires vitamin C for hydroxylation (cannot synthesize without ascorbic acid cofactor)

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q: Why are these 4 supplements suddenly needed if the plan has been working?
**A**: Recent migrations (067-068) identified gaps that weren't in the original database. K2, B-complex, CoQ10, and collagen have strong RCT evidence for strength athletes, but were initially overlooked. They represent high-impact additions (not emergencies, but optimal additions).

### Q: Do I need to wait for blood test results before ordering supplements?
**A**: No. K2, B-complex, CoQ10, collagen have no UL/toxicity risk and are universally beneficial. Order immediately (2026-03-05). D3 adjustment should wait for 2026-03-31 results.

### Q: What if my serum D3 comes back at 60 ng/mL (high)?
**A**: Reduce to 1000 IU/day (keep Nature Made tablet, discontinue Doctor's Best standalone). Retest in 3 months.

### Q: What if my copper labs are low?
**A**: Increase from 2mg to 2.5-3mg/day. Order Solaray 2.5mg or 3mg tablets from iHerb. Retest in 3 months.

### Q: Can I start collagen and CoQ10 before the blood test?
**A**: Yes. These have no contraindications, perfect absorption with lunch fats, zero drug interactions.

### Q: How much time does the daily routine take?
**A**: 5-10 minutes. All supplements taken at lunch (with meal) + sleep routine (evening). No additional time vs current plan.
